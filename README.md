# Introduction
This is my submission for the course project from the Coursera Getting & Cleaning Data Course.
The main purpose of this project is to transform an existing data set (from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
The expected output is a set of 2 files containing each a tidy data set (tidyDS1.txt and tidyDS2.txt) along with a script (run_analysis.R) to create these files, a Code Book describing the tidy data sets (CodeBook.md) and a Readme file (README.md)

# Instruction
(taken from the Course Website)
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
