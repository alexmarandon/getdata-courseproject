# Introduction
This is my submission for the course project from the Coursera Getting & Cleaning Data Course.
The main purpose of this project is to transform an existing data set (from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
The expected output is a set of 2 files containing each a tidy data set (tidyDS1.txt and tidyDS2.txt) along with a script (run_analysis.R) to create these files, a Code Book describing the tidy data sets (CodeBook.md) and a Readme file (README.md)

# Instructions
(taken from the Course Website)
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in the previous step creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
